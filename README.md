# run_wot_replay
runs a wot replay file

git clone this or download the zip then
```
chmod a+x run_wot_replay 
```
put it on your path or prefix with ./
```
./run_wot_replay -h 
```
prints some hopefully helpful text to screen

 
```
./run_wot_replay 
```
runs the last saved replay
```
./run_wot_replay name of replay.wotreplay
```
runs "name of replay.wotreplay" from the default wot folder
if the replay file is in your current directory it will run that one.
